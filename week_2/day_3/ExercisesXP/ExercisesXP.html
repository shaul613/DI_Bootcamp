//Exercise 1
//-------------------------------
  let people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];
  // Part I - Review About Arrays
  // Write code to remove “Greg” from the people array.
people.splice(people.indexOf("Greg"),1);
  // Write code to replace “James” to “Jason”.
people.splice(people.indexOf("James"), 1, "Jason")
  // Write code to add your name to the end of the people array.
people.push("Shaul");
  // Write code that console.logs Mary’s index. take a look at the indexOf method on Google.
console.log(people.indexOf("Mary"));
  // Write code to make a copy of the people array using the slice method.
  // The copy should NOT include “Mary” or your name.
  // Hint: remember that now the people array should look like this
  // let people = ["Mary", "Devon", "Jason", "Yourname"];
  // Hint: Check out the documentation for the slice method
let peopleCopy = people.slice(1);
  // Write code that gives the index of “Foo”. Why does it return -1 ?
let indexOfFoo = people.indexOf("Foo");
console.log(`indexOfFoo returns ${indexOfFoo} becasue the 'indexOf' method returns -1 when
the item in () does not exist.`);
  // Create a variable called last which value is the last element of the array.
  // Hint: What is the relationship between the index of the last element in the array and the
  //  length of the array?
  // Part II - Loops
  // Using a loop, iterate through the people array and console.log each person.
  // Using a loop, iterate through the people array and exit the loop after you console.log “Jason” .
  // Hint: take a look at the break statement in the lesson.
