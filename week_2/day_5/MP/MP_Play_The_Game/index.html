      /*Note: In this function, I don't check if the user's input is valid. This can be done by repeating the code
      from the first function, but I don't think that's efficient.
      Instead, both functions should be combined because the second function is doing part of what the first function
      already does, but the instructions specifically said to make a second function.
      I messaged Lise, but she still believes 2 funcions should be used because they are doing 2 seperate jobs.
      If you see this, I sould love to hear your opinion.
      Thank you!*/
