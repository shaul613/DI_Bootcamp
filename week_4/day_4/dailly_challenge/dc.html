// In this exercise, you will use object oriented programming concepts to define and use a custom object
// in JavaScript.
// Create a class named Video. The class should be constructed with the following parameters:
// title (a string)
// uploader (a string, the person who uploaded it)
// time (a number, the duration of the video - in seconds)
// Create a method called watch() which displays a string as follows:
// “uploader parameter watched all time parameter of title parameter!”
// Instantiate a new Video instance and call the watch() method.
// Instantiate a second Video instance with different values.
// Bonus: Use an array to store data for five Video instances (ie. title, uploader, time)
// Think of the best data structure to save this information within the array.
// Bonus: Loop through the array to instantiate those instances.
class Video{
  constructor(title, uploader, time){
    this.title = title;
    this.uploader = uploader;
    this.time = time;
  }

  watch(){
    return `${this.uploader} watched all ${this.time} of ${this.title}!`;
  }
}

let videoOne = new Video("the movie", "stephan", 12541);
